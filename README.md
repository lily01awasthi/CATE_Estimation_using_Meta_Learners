# CATE_Estimation_using_Meta_Learners
Applying meta-learner models (T, S, X, R-learners) to estimate CATE in educational interventions. Project aims to analyze treatment effects using machine learning models.
# This Project will focus on following Research Questions
## Causal Inference with Different Meta-Learners:
* Question: "How do different meta-learners (T-Learner, S-Learner, X-Learner, R-Learner) compare in estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) in educational settings with binary treatment?"
* Context: Given the binary nature of the treatment, a thorough comparison of meta-learners could reveal which method provides the most accurate or interpretable results in this context.
* Hypothesis: One meta-learner might perform consistently better than others in capturing the true CATE, possibly due to the nature of the educational intervention and the structure of the data.
## Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Across Student and School Demographics:

* Question: "How does the effectiveness of the growth mindset intervention (Z) on student achievement vary across different demographic groups and school contexts?"
* Context: Examine how the treatment effect (CATE) differs for students of different races/ethnicities, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as in different types of schools (urban vs. rural, high vs. low achievement levels, etc.).
* Hypothesis: The intervention might be more effective in certain demographics or school settings, such as schools with higher poverty rates or for first-generation college students.
## Interaction Effects Between Student-Level and School-Level Variables:
* Question: "What are the interaction effects between student-level and school-level covariates on the effectiveness of the growth mindset intervention?"
* Context: Explore how combinations of student-level factors (e.g., race, gender, first-generation status) and school-level factors (e.g., urbanicity, school achievement level) influence the treatment effect.
* Hypothesis: There could be significant interaction effects, such as the intervention being particularly effective for minority students in low-achieving schools, or less effective in high-poverty schools regardless of other factors.
