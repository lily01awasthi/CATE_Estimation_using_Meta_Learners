    "3. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: Demographic and School-Level Interactions\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "To assess how the growth mindset intervention varies across different demographic groups and school contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Action Steps:\n",
    "Subgroup Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate whether the treatment effect varies across demographic groups such as:\n",
    "Race/Ethnicity (C1): As we saw from the count plots, certain race/ethnicity groups dominate the sample. Focus on categories with larger sample sizes.\n",
    "Gender (C2): Since gender is well-balanced, this is an important demographic to investigate.\n",
    "First-generation college status (C3): First-generation students may respond differently to the intervention.\n",
    "School-Level Moderators:\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate how the intervention’s effectiveness varies across different school characteristics such as:\n",
    "School urbanicity (XC): Urban, suburban, and rural schools may respond differently to the intervention.\n",
    "School achievement levels (X2): Use the past achievement data to see if high-achieving schools benefit more from the intervention compared to lower-achieving schools.\n",
    "Interaction Effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider adding interaction terms between the treatment variable (Z) and key covariates to your model, as you’ve already done with some variables.\n",
    "For example, analyze the interaction between treatment (Z) and fixed mindset (X1), which seems to have the strongest correlation with student achievement.\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) and SHAP values to visualize how these factors influence the treatment effect.\n",
    "Consider using faceted plots or regression lines to show how the treatment effect varies across subgroups."
