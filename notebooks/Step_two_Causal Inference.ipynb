    "2. Causal Inference: Estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "To assess how different meta-learners (T-Learner, S-Learner, X-Learner, R-Learner) estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) in this educational setting, where the treatment is binary (growth mindset intervention).\n",
    "\n",
    "Action Steps:\n",
    "Model Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the different meta-learners (e.g., T-Learner, S-Learner, X-Learner, R-Learner).\n",
    "Use student achievement (Y) as the outcome and treatment (Z) as the binary intervention variable.\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your correlation matrix, select relevant features that might moderate the effect of the treatment. Key variables include:\n",
    "Fixed Mindset (X1): Schools with different mindset levels might respond differently to the intervention.\n",
    "School Achievement Level (X2): Higher or lower-achieving schools might show varied responses.\n",
    "Minority Composition (X3) and Poverty Concentration (X4): Demographic factors that could moderate the intervention effect.\n",
    "Model Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the performance of each meta-learner in terms of estimating the treatment effect. Metrics to evaluate include:\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "Interpretability of results.\n",
    "Cross-validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform cross-validation to ensure the robustness of your CATE estimates across different subsets of the data"
