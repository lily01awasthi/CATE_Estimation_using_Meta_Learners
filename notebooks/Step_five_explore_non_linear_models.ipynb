    "Objective:\n",
    "Given that some of your correlations are weak and likely non-linear, investigate non-linear models that could capture more complex relationships.\n",

    "Action Steps:\n",
    "Tree-based Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider using Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to capture non-linear interactions between variables.\n",
    "Evaluate feature importance using SHAP values, which will give you more insight into how each feature contributes to the model predictions.\n",
    "Model Interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use SHAP summary plots and interaction plots to understand how school-level variables interact with the treatment variable.\n",
    "Consider using Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) to visualize the non-linear effects of variables like fixed mindset (X1) and school achievement (X2)."
