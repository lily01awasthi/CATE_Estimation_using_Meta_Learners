2. Causal Inference: Estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)
Objective:
To assess how different meta-learners (T-Learner, S-Learner, X-Learner, R-Learner) estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) in this educational setting, where the treatment is binary (growth mindset intervention).

Action Steps:
Model Setup:

Implement the different meta-learners (e.g., T-Learner, S-Learner, X-Learner, R-Learner).
Use student achievement (Y) as the outcome and treatment (Z) as the binary intervention variable.
Feature Selection:

Based on your correlation matrix, select relevant features that might moderate the effect of the treatment. Key variables include:
Fixed Mindset (X1): Schools with different mindset levels might respond differently to the intervention.
School Achievement Level (X2): Higher or lower-achieving schools might show varied responses.
Minority Composition (X3) and Poverty Concentration (X4): Demographic factors that could moderate the intervention effect.
Model Evaluation:

Compare the performance of each meta-learner in terms of estimating the treatment effect. Metrics to evaluate include:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Interpretability of results.
Cross-validation:

Perform cross-validation to ensure the robustness of your CATE estimates across different subsets of the data.
